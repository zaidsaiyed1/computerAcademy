# Heart Disease Prediction System

## Overview

This project is a heart disease risk prediction system developed as part of an internship at Nichetech. The system allows users to fill out a health information form, 
and based on the input data, it predicts the user's risk level of heart disease. The project uses machine learning on a healthcare dataset related to heart disease, 
aiming to provide an accessible tool for preliminary health assessments.

## Features

User Health Form: A form where users can enter key health metrics.
Risk Prediction: The system evaluates the user's risk of heart disease based on the provided data and generates a risk level report.
Data Handling: Efficient data processing using SQLite for backend storage.

## Technologies Used

**Django:** Framework for developing and structuring the web application.

**SQLite:** Lightweight database for storing user information and prediction data.

**Healthcare Dataset:** A dataset containing relevant information about heart disease, used for training the prediction model.
